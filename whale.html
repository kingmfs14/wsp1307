			<p>Splash! We bring you close enough to the whales you will not leave without getting wet. Our whale specialist introduces you to the whales in a
			way no other specialist can. We also have an in house photographer who has won awards for her impossible shots. She will take your picture with a 
			whale, so close your friends will be convinced it has been photoshopped...guaranteed! Unlike our kayaking excursion, we encourage hands, feet, and 
			other extremities out of the sailboat. Some people let you swim with dolphins, but we allow you to swim with whales.</p>
			
			<p>Join us for this once in a life time one on one whale watching excursion. This is a private tour with luxurious seating for up to six passengers. 
			Our vessel brings you closer than ever before to the majestic beauty of the humpback whales. This private tour can be anywhere from two to eight 
			hours long and includes meals, drinks and opportunities for unreal photographs.  Our specialized whale biologist has won numerous awards for their 
			immense knowledge of and ability to communicate with the whales.  Not only do we guarantee you will see whales on this adventure, we guarantee it 
			will be the best whale watch you have ever been on.</p>
