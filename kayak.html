			<p>Watch out! On this kayaking adventure, you must keep your arms, legs, and other extremities inside the kayak at all times. If you so much
			as think about touching the water, then you will be put in time out. Since there are no corners in the ocean, your time out will be spent, attached
			by a leash to your instructor. All jokes aside, we have been awarded numerous times on our excellent kayaking adventure. We have never had a single
			complaint or heard anything but joy and laughter from our grateful customers.</p>
			
			<p>This adventure is an immaculate trip with otherwise inaccessible snorkeling sites. The stony shoreline in this area is a hushed and private part 
			of Maui seldom observed by visitors. During our roundtrip paddle along the striking shoreline, you will be astonished with the rock faces leading 
			down to the waters which are surrounded by stunning coral reefs.  This adventure is filled with colorful reef eco-systems, and a immense collection 
			of vibrant reef fish. The prospect exists to see dolphins, rays, and whales (in season). This adventure consists of a 5 mile round-trip paddle and 
			takes approximately 5 hours. The fun starts at our loading dock where all of our guests get to pick their paddle and homemade lunch.</p>
			
			<p>This adventure is a full body work out and does require a certain level of skill, however if anyone does find themselves too exhausted to paddle 
			back, we can drag them out. Be prepared to have a trip that will last a lifetime. It may take a little physical effort on your part, but the reward 
			will be well worth the effort put in. Our guides will be right along with you to assist when needed. Techniques to make it easier on your paddling and
			ways to use the current for your benefit are just a couple of the tricks of the trade that will be passed on to you during this excursion.</p>
