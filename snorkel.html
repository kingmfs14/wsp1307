			<p>Snorkeling is a great way for our beginner and intermediate swimmers to explore the world below. Underwater wildlife is a beauty
			to be shared with all who are willing to observe and preserve its beauty. On our snorkeling adventures, we introduce you to the wildlife
			and give you an appreciation for its purpose in our eco-system. These are unlike any other snorkeling tours. You will not regret joining 
			us for this fun filled and educational tour of the reefs and surface level sea life.</p>
			
			<p>For the less skilled snorkeler, we have common trips among shallow reefs near Kaanapali, Wailea, Makena, Kihei, Kapalua, and Honolua Bay. 
			These more relaxing areas are perfect for allowing the marine life to join you in a swim and even pose for the perfect picture. You will be 
			shown spots along the reef where the friendliest animals enjoy to hang out. We take daily trips to these spots to offer a wide opportunity to
			you. Come anytime and we will take you along for the excursion for the day. Walk-ins are welcomed!</p>
			
			<p>For the more advance snorkeler, we offer trips to the backside of Maui, Hana and la perouse. We will begin our trip first thing in the
			morning since generally in the afternoon the wind picks up and creates choppy water. The reef remains untouched and the marine life is very
			friendly on this side of the island. Friendly fish makes for perfect pictures! You will be guided in and out of the reefs that are populated
			with fish, eels, rays, and turtles. A fun packed trip is guaranteed or your money back. Come enjoy our trips to the back side on any of the
			three days that we go. We would love your company.</p>
