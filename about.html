			<p>In each excursion whether on a relaxing sailboat ride to see the humpback whales or diving for dinner, you 
			will be treated like royalty from our well trained and experienced staff. We have a <em>wealth of knowledge</em> from 
			the locals on island that will treat you to some of the most well fished reefs for either snorkeling, scuba diving, or 
			spear fishing. Most of our staff have been in the waters of Maui for more than <strong>13 years</strong> and with experience 
			comes the knowledge it takes to show things that other can't. Every excursion includes assistance from several of our 
			staff to insure that every individual in a party has been treated with answers to questions, guidance when needed, and 
			assistance when asked.</p> 
			
			<p>Carry, our marine biologist, has been studying whale patterns in Maui for more than <strong>15 years</strong>. She has 
			studied the songs of the whales along with behavior patterns that guarantee a pleasant time aboard our 20 foot catamaran. 
			She also assists our kayaking crew to take the tour to the areas where whales travel the most. She makes the spectacle of
			active whales come to life with her expertise in the whale world.</p>

			<p>Each one of our staff members have been trained and demonstrate unique experience in the field in which they will be 
			taking you out on one of our excursions. You will be treated with respect and overwhelmed with the island "aloha" feel.
			The majority of our staff have been born and raised on the island of Maui and the rest have been immersed in the waters of
			Maui for over 13 years. You will never regret going out one of our special excursions that will fit each individual needs.</p>
